# Brainhack Today I Leanrt(TIL) AI Camp 2019 Write-up
This is a write-up of my experience at brainhack TIL AI Camp 2019 hosted by DSTA.  
The source code to what I did as well as the team's final code is in this respository.  
For some explaination of how to use the code and what is going on, read the README.md file of the respective python note books. If there is no README file, there will be some sort of explaination in the python notebook itself.
## Short Version/TL:DR
This was my first experience at a hackathon/coding competition, and was also the first time I was exposed to Artifical Intelligence(AI) and deep learning.

Note: Before I starting talking about anything, I'd like to point out some things.
* This write-up is based on my experience at the camp, as such it may not fully reflect the views of my teammates.(If they do make their own write-ups I'll be sure to link them above :D)
* All credit goes to the respective authors of the github repos and downloaded models used in the notebooks.
* When I refer to the AI camp, I am refering to the whole event.
