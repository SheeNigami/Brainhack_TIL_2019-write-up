# Brainhack Today I Leanrt(TIL) AI Camp 2019 Write-up
This is a write-up of my experience at brainhack TIL AI Camp 2019 hosted by DSTA.  
The source code to what I did as well as the team's final code is in this respository.  
For some explaination of how to use the code and what is going on, read the README.md file of the respective python note books. If there is no README file, there will be some sort of explaination in the python notebook itself.
## Short Version/TL:DR
This was my first experience at a hackathon/coding competition, and was also the first time I was exposed to Artifical Intelligence(AI) and deep learning.
